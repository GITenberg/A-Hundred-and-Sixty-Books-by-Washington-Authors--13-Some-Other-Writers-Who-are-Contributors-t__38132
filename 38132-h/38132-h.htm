<p class="center"><span class="huge">FOREWORD</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our state literature is strongest in local lines. First in early history
and narration of personal adventure. Fortunately our most important
histories are written by men who have long been residents. Meany, Lyman,
Durham, Snowden and Bagley have themselves been a part of the story and
have learned much at first-hand. Their pages have a flavor of personal
interest which some histories lack.</p>

<p>The adventures of today become the history of tomorrow. Even the most
commonplace narration of experience in a new country has its value.
Those original documents, whether diary, letters, memoir or
autobiography are the delight of one who has the true historian's
instinct.</p>

<p>The mythology of the tribes that eighty years ago held possession of
this territory is native romance, a literary asset which has been well
developed. Lyman has collected the myths and legends of the peoples on
the Columbia. Williams tells those that cluster about Mount Rainier.
Meany, Curtis and other historians have enlivened their text by these
romances and Miss Judson has made the field her own.</p>

<p>A second treasure supply of the state lies in its natural wonders and
beauties. What other state can boast of charms so varied? No other
country has scenery surpassing in grandeur our mountains and forests, or
more beautiful than our inland sea with its emerald shores and islands.</p>

<p>Williams is not alone in exploiting this rich treasure. A score of
others have found in it the source of mood for their songs or the frame
for a story or romance.</p>

<p>In philosophic essay and the higher forms of pure belles-lettres the
proportion of writings is not so large as in the old literary centers.
Thought and time are still requisitioned for the founding of
institutions. Few are the leisure-class people who pursue writing as an
art. Yet one who cares to investigate will discover that no other state
while so young has shown a richer output of literature, in content, in
scope or in character.</p>

<p>Perhaps this first published list will add to the number of those who do
care to investigate. Perhaps too it will result in a wider acquaintance
among those who are following the same undying art. Some day Washington
writers will band together for mutual benefit.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="huge">HISTORY</span></p>

<p class="hang"><b>1. Blazing the Way.</b> (1909.) Emily Inez Denny. Pioneer home-life pictured
by the daughter of the early settler who wrote No. 21.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>2. Columbia River, Its History, Its Myths, Its Scenery, Its Commerce.</b>
(1909.) William Dennison Lyman. Fully descriptive and reciting personal
adventures. Professor Lyman, long-time teacher of history in Whitman
College, has lived his whole life in the country he describes. The book
contains many Indian legends. Eighty illustrations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>3. The Conquerors.</b> (1907.) Rev. A. Atwood. Dedicated to Jason Lee and
the pioneer missionaries who laid the foundations of American
institutions in old Oregon. Much about Lee whose missionary labors
antedated Marcus Whitman's by two years. To some extent it touches the
so-called Whitman controversy, a discussion due in part to the fact that
the admirers of Whitman claimed too much for a patriot whose services
needed no exaggeration. It has the endorsement of the Washington State
Historical Society.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>4. Glimpses in Pioneer Life on Puget Sound.</b> (1903.) Same author. A
history of the Methodist Episcopal Church on the Pacific Coast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>5. David S. Maynard and Catherine T. Maynard.</b> (1906.) T. W. Prosch.
Biography of two of the immigrants of 1850. Mrs. Maynard is honored in
Seattle as the founder of a free reading room which grew into the Young
Men's Christian Association of the city.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>6. Gettysburg.</b> (1911.) Captain R. K. Beecham. An account of the great
battle. Acknowledged to be most complete and accurate as to facts and it
is written with the fire of a patriot and a poet. The veteran returns to
visit the battle-field where as a youth half a century before he fought
for the flag. Through his eyes and memories the reader sees events.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span><b>7. History of Puget Sound Country.</b> (1903.) Colonel William Farland
Prosser. The late president of the State Historical Society compiled
this work in two large volumes, a painstaking and valuable reference
work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>8. History of Seattle.</b> (1916.) Clarence B. Bagley. Three large volumes.
Very comprehensive. The third volume is wholly biographical.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>9. In the Beginning.</b> (1905.) Same author. A sketch of events in Western
Washington while it was still a part of old Oregon. Published
separately, also in the 1909 edition of Meeker's "Pioneer
Reminiscences."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>10. History of the State of Washington.</b> (1909.) Edmond S. Meany. The
most accurate and complete history of the state. In some measure it
covers the whole Pacific slope. It is intended for school use but will
interest any one who likes to study or read history. The story is
divided into discovery, exploration, occupation, territorial days and
statehood, each treated clearly and fully. The author, professor of
history in the University of Washington, is a hero-worshipper and
extolls the daring of the adventurer and the patience and courage of the
pioneer.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>11. Vancouver's Discovery of Puget Sound.</b> (1907.) Same author. Largely
the journal of the discoverer with extensive notes, many portraits and
biographies of the men whose names were given to geographic features of
the Northwest. A most important piece of historic research. A fitting
supplement to this work is</p>

<p class="hang"><b>12. A New Vancouver Journal on the Discovery of Puget Sound, by a Member
of the Chatham's Crew.</b> (1915.) Edited by Professor Meany.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>13. United States History for Schools.</b> (1912.) Shows the development of
America as part of world history. This has met with general approval as
a text-book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>14. History of Washington, The Rise and Progress of an American State.</b>
(1909-1911.) Clinton A. Snowden. Four elegant volumes in half-leather
and rich in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> illustrations. Two later volumes issued as supplements are
wholly biographical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>15. The Iron Way.</b> (1907.) Sarah Pratt Carr. The story of the building of
the Central Pacific, the first transcontinental railway.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>16. The Cost of Empire.</b> Same author. The record of the Whitman massacre.
It was made the basis of the opera "Narcissa" of which Mrs Carr's
daughter, Mary Carr Moore, wrote the music.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>17. Life of Isaac Ingalls Stevens.</b> (1900.) Hazard Stevens. The two
volumes contain much information about the early Indian wars, councils
and treaties. They show the simplicity of official form during the life
of the first Governor of the Territory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>18. Marcus Whitman, Pathfinder and Patriot.</b> (1909.) Rev. Myron Eells.
The author is son of Rev. Cushing Eells, founder of Whitman College and
personal friend and co-worker with Whitman.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>19. Fathers Eells, or the Results of 55 Years of Missionary Labor in
Washington and Oregon</b>, by the same author, is a biography of the father.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>20. Memoirs of Orange Jacobs.</b> (1908.) Written by himself after a life of
eighty years, fifty-six of them spent in Oregon and Washington. It
contains a good account of the Seattle fire of 1889.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>21. Pioneer Days on Puget Sound.</b> (1888 and 1908.) Arthur A. Denny. An
interesting autobiography and valuable for its story of the founding of
Seattle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>22. Pioneer Reminiscences of Puget Sound, The Tragedy of Leschi.</b> (1905.)
Ezra Meeker. An account of the coming of the first whites, their
encounters with the red race, the first treaties with the Indians, the
war that followed, and the cruise of the author on Puget Sound fifty
years ago. One edition contains Bagley's In the Beginning.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span><b>23. The Ox Team; or The Old Oregon Trail.</b> (1906.) The story of a slow
and eventful journey by ox team from the Middle West to this territory
more than sixty years ago. Mr. Meeker and his oxen have been a
conspicuous feature of several western expositions and are a picturesque
relic of the fast-fading pioneer life. Today, Ezra Meeker, eighty-four
years old, is crossing the continent in a "schoonermobile," a motor car
built on the lines of the old-time prairie schooner. It contains a bed,
a stove and a hunting outfit. He is retracing the journey of the ox
cart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>24. Russian Expansion on the Pacific, 1641-1850, An Account of the
Expeditions Made by the Russians Along the Pacific.</b> Frank Alfred Golder.
In January 1914 the author was sent to St. Petersburg to catalogue the
materials in the Russian archives relating to America. The work was done
for the Carnegie Institute, department of historical research. Professor
Golder is one of the few American historians who are familiar with the
Russian language and his selection was complimentary to him and to the
State College.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>25. The Siwash, Their Life, Legends and Tales.</b> (1895.) J. A. Costello,
an old resident of Puget Sound. The material was gathered chiefly from
the Indians themselves. This book contains a good description of Chief
Seattle. Out of print.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>26. Spokane and The Inland Empire.</b> (1912.) Mr. N. W. Durham. In three
large volumes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>27. Syllabus of Continental European History from Fall of Rome to 1870.</b>
(1904.) Oliver Huntington Richardson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>28. Tillicum Tales of Thurston County.</b> (1914.) Mrs. George Blankenship.
Full of historical material of more than local value and interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span><b>29. Washington and Its Swedish Population.</b> (1905.) Ernst Teofil
Skarsteadt. The author has been a resident of the state fourteen years.
As newspaper man and contributor to Eastern journals he has well covered
the life of his fellow-countrymen in this state. He has written on
subjects sociological, historical, agricultural and biographical.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>30. Our Heroes of the Pen.</b> Mr. Skarsteadt considers this his most
valuable work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="huge">TRAVEL AND DESCRIPTION</span></p>

<p>Books on Alaska would fill a long shelf. Three are particularly
entertaining and rich in description.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>31. Alaska, an Empire in the Making.</b> (1913.) John Jasper Underwood.
Written after fourteen years continuous residence in Alaska and the
Yukon Territory. The writer, a newspaper man, sees things from the
impersonal viewpoint of the journalist with a keen appetite for news.
For a time he ran the "farthest north" newspaper, which sold for "ivory,
gold-dust and skins." These words are characteristic of his
wide-sweeping vision: "Here is a land of 25,000 miles of coastline and
with 6,000 miles of navigable waterways." The United States bureau of
education has put this on the list as a standard work on Alaska.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>32. Alaska, Its Meaning to the World, Its Resources, Its Opportunities.</b>
(1914.) Charles R. Tuttle. A good deal of space is given to the history
of the Government railway legislation. It lauds the energy of the
Seattle Chamber of Commerce which conducted a successful lobby in
Washington city during the anxious months while the Alaska railway bill
hung fire in Congress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>33. Alaska, the Great Country.</b> (1908.) Ella Higginson. This third book
is by a lady whom many love to call "our foremost story-teller and
sweetest singer." It is most personal, crowded with real adventures,
some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> of them humorous, which the reader shares vividly. Mrs. Higginson
says, "No one writer has ever described Alaska. No one writer can ever
describe it, but each must do his share according to the spell the
country casts upon him." Her description is bright and fascinating. She
is now revising it and bringing it up to date for a new edition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>34. American Fur Trade of the Far West.</b> (1902.) Hiram Martin Chittenden.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>35. Yellowstone National Park, Historical and Descriptive.</b> Same author.</p>

<p>No. 34 is a history of the pioneer trading posts and early fur companies
of the Missouri River and Rocky Mountains and of overland commerce.</p>

<p>No. 35 is the author's best known work. A fifth edition was published in
1905. No man has had a better opportunity to know the Yellowstone than
Gen. Chittenden who was in charge of the government work there and no
writer more evenly combines the scientific mind of the practical
engineer with the charm of a poetic and artistic observer. To read this
is next best to seeing the park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>36. The City That Made Itself; A Literary and Pictorial Record of the
Building of Seattle.</b> (1914.) Welford Beaton. Printed in a choice
leatherbound silk-lined finely illustrated edition of three hundred
copies which readily found their way to the libraries of the well-to-do.
The book tells of the hills that have been laid low, of the valleys that
have been filled, the tide flats that have been redeemed, of the street
car lines and electric development. One chapter on the "Ladies Library
Association" shows how women laid the foundation of the public library.
Another chapter describes the architecture of the metropolis "from log
cabin to sky scraper."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>37. Fifteen Thousand Miles by Stage.</b> (1911.) Carrie Adell Strahorn. A
woman's unique experience during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> thirty years of pathfinding and
pioneering from the Missouri River to the Pacific and from Alaska to
Mexico. An unusually interesting narration of the days when travel was
beset with different if not more dangers than today. The book is put out
attractively with 350 illustrations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>38. Guardians of the Columbia.</b> (1912.) John H. Williams.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>39. The Mountain That Was God.</b> (1910.) Same author.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>40. Yosemite and the High Sierras.</b> (1914.) Same author. They are books
of rare value, occupying a field by themselves. They are full of
fascinating word pictures of mountain scenes. The first is of Mt. Hood,
Mt. Adams and Mt. St. Helens. The city librarian of a Massachusetts city
wrote to Mr. Williams "We have a radiopticon in our library. I shall
mount the illustrations from your book and use the text for short talks
on the mountains." No. 39 pictures Rainier which is called
"Rainier-Tacoma." John Muir wrote "The glorious mountain is indebted to
you for your magnificent book and so is every mountaineer." This
contains the "flora of the mountain slopes" by J. B. Flett. The third
book is dedicated to the Sierra Club with an introductory poem by Robert
Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>41. The North American Indian.</b> (1908-1915.) Edward S. Curtis. It is
doubtful if any book which has to do with our state has attracted to it
so much notice as these ten volumes of Indian lore illustrated by superb
photographs taken by the author. He spent years in getting first hand
acquaintance with some of the tribes and in securing the pictures which
have made him famous. Theodore Roosevelt wrote the preface and J.
Pierpont Morgan subscribed $3,000 as an advance guarantee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>42. Rambles in Colonial Byways.</b> (1900.) Rufus Rockwell Wilson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span><b>43. Romance of Feudal Chateaux.</b> (1900.) Elizabeth Williams Champney.
This is one of a delightful series written in part before the author was
a resident of the state. The others are</p>

<p class="hang"><b>44. Romance of French Abbeys.</b> (1905.)</p>

<p class="hang"><b>45. Romance of Italian Villas.</b> (1906.)</p>

<p class="hang"><b>46. Romance of Renaissance Chateaux.</b> (1907.)</p>

<p class="hang"><b>47. Romance of Bourbon Chateaux.</b> (1907.)</p>

<p class="hang"><b>48. Romance of Roman Villas.</b> (1908.)</p>

<p class="hang"><b>49. Romance of Imperial Rome.</b> (1910.) Mrs. Champney also wrote Great
Grandmothers' Girls in New France and Three Vassar Girls.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>50. Romance of Old Belgium, from Caesar to Kaiser.</b> (1915.) Elizabeth
Williams Champney and Frere Champney. A choice story full of the romance
of truth. The illustrations are from Rubens' paintings, photographs and
original pen and ink drawings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>51. Seven Weeks in Hawaii.</b> (1913.) Minnie Leola Crawford.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>52. Seven Weeks in the Orient.</b> (1914.) Same author. Vacation letters,
written by a business girl who was enjoying her trip to the full, were
sent to the mother at home. They were passed on to be read by friends
who saw that there was more than a personal interest in them and
insisted on their publication. A Chicago publisher readily accepted
them. Another vacation trip led to the second volume. The style is
sprightly and original and photographs of the author's own taking
illustrate both books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>53. Seven Years on the Pacific Slope.</b> (1914.) Mrs. Hugh Fraser and Hugh
C. Fraser. The writers lived in Okanogan County in a little village on
the Methow River near its junction with the Columbia. They tell of
ordinary events but give a clear picture of the development of that
region from 1905 to 1912.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>54. Reminiscences of a Diplomatist's Wife.</b> (1912.) Either alone or in
collaboration Mrs. Fraser has published ten volumes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="huge">SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>55. Birds of Washington.</b> William Leon Dawson and John Hooper Bowles. Two
elegant volumes describing 372 species. There are three hundred original
halftone illustrations. An analytical key for identification, by Lynds
Jones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>56. Digest of the Decisions of the Supreme Court of Washington.</b> Arthur
Remington. Two volumes and supplement.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>57. Remington and Ballinger's Annotated Codes and Statutes of
Washington.</b> Two volumes and supplement. (1913.)</p>

<p class="hang"><b>58. Remington's 1915 Codes and Statutes of Washington.</b> (1916.) Two
volumes.</p>

and George B. Rigg.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>60. Encyclopaedia of Practical Horticulture.</b> (1915.) Granville Lowther
and William Worthington. Three large volumes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang"><b>61. English Literature from Widsith to the Death of Chaucer. A Source
Book.</b> (1916.) Allen Rogers Benham. It pictures the literary world in
which Englishmen lived from early times to the year 1400 and represents
ten years' work by the author.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>62. Essentials of Character.</b> (1910.) Edward O. Sisson. A practical study
of education in moral character.</p>

Since then she has written scores of stories which have appeared in many
different magazines. She has handled some types which are accepted in
the far east as representative of the west and are not complimentary to
the good taste and social polish of this longitude. But no author of the
state has been ranked so high by the reviewers and critics. All her
literary work has been done in this state. She shows constantly

starvation in Alaska, the fatal avalanche in the Cascades in the winter
of 1909-1910 at Wellington, all are woven into the story. It includes
also an attack on the Roosevelt-Pinchot conservation policy which
reflects the sentiment somewhat widely held on the Pacific Coast. These
features have helped to give the story a wide reading near home but it
is a good seller the country over. Very speedily it reached a fourth
edition and in its first year sales reached fifty thousand. Mrs.
Anderson is the daughter of a Washington pioneer. Those who know her
tell us that her home-making and family-raising are as successful as her

some Christmas books for her little friends she did not find what she
liked. She was not pleased with the idea of filling children's heads
with nonsense rhymes, good only to be forgotten, and the crazy pictures
of children's books were not all of them to her liking. Like the
president of a California University, she too made a book for little
people. He did it by writing rhymes still more nonsensical and
impossible. She did it by putting into jingle form some facts of United
States history. The pictures are attractive and true to period. The
rhymes are as catchy as Simple Simon and Jack Horner, but when a child
has sung these over for a few weeks he knows for keeps some people and
some happenings in American history.</p>

Post-Intelligencer developed this form which gave him fame. Many readers
turned first each morning to his column on the third page to see what
"K. C. B." had to say. That little morning story was always an appeal to
the heart, sometimes as a fountain of tears, sometimes as a wellspring
of joy. A friend writes of him "He is a temperamental freak in that he

emotions."</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">A man's success depends alone on That Something. That Something of his
soul. Abraham Lincoln found it and it warmed the cold floor on which he
lay and studied. It added light to the flickering glow of the wood fire,
that he might see to read.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">It spurred him on and on and on.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">That Something is an awful force.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">It made of a puny Corsican the Ruler of the World.</span></p>

<p>It made of a thin-chested bookkeeper the money king of his age.</p>

<p>It made of Edison the great man of a great country.</p>

<p>It made Carnegie. It made Woodrow Wilson. It made Roosevelt.</p>

<p>It can make you.</p>

<p>And it is now in your soul. Awake it now. "That Something."</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">"No, it can't be done, it can't be done," murmured the professor. "I
have drunk deeply of the cup of life, and I am now drinking of the
dregs. The cup is filled but once, and when it's gone there's nothing
left but old age and poverty."</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">"You fool," cried Randolph, leaning forward and shaking the little man
roughly. "You almost had That Something within your power, and now you

their own digging for centuries past.</span></p>

chiding, for the justice you bred into me and the honor you made mine.
All that I am you taught me.</p>

<p>For the times that I hurt you, the times I had no smile for you, the
caresses that I did not give you, my mother forgive me. For your lessons
I did not learn, for your wishes I did not heed, for the counsels I did
not obey, my mother, forgive me. Forgive me my pride in my youth and my
glory in my strength that forgot the holiness of your years and the
veneration of your weakness,&mdash;for my neglect, for my selfishness, for

<p>The good we can think of is always possible.</p>

<p>To dole out a few turkeys at Christmas is good; but to have a social
order where every man can buy his own turkey is vastly better.</p>

<p>Real sympathy is motional as well as emotional; energetic, as well as
pathetic, taking no pleasure in "tears, idle tears."</p>

<p>Some people seem to enjoy giving publicity to their disappointments.</p>

<p>Women understand men better than men understand women.</p>

<p>The only personalities who hold permanently the devotion and admiration
of humanity are the idealists.</p>

<p>You can preach the gospel through a handshake, a glance, a laugh, a
lifting word.</p>

<p>What we don't know, never frightens us; it is what we half-know which is
the fertile seed-plot of fear.</p>

<p>Golf is an artificial substitute for man's native need for work in the
open air.</p>

<p>What we really care for in people is not their social standing nor the
fashionableness of their haberdashery, but their kindness, reliability
and integrity.</p>

<p>God has no stepchildren.</p>

<p>Naked, brutal force has never settled anything yet. Stoning Stephen to
death only gave him a more distinguished immortality.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
